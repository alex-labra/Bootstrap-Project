LIVE VERSION: http://35.85.52.246/bootstrap-project/

email.html is the main project 

After I was done with the main project I decided to add functionality by creating a server and
deploying the website.
I added a login page and a register page with a fully functional database. To complete this tasks 
I had to use PHP for the backend and JavaScript(jQuery and AJAX) for the front end.

As most of the project was done in an AWS Ubuntu Server there is no functionality in Visual Studio and
will only be fully functional at the given live version above.
SQL schema is also included within this Readme folder.

All html files will run without a problem in VS Code without much functionality as verification can only
happen within the server.

SERVER NOTES: Server is running on an AWS instance using Apache for the website deployment. (LAMP)
